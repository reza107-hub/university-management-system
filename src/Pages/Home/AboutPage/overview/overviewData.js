      question: "BRIEF HISTORY",
      answer: [
        "Commencement of the WTO regime along with the incredible advancements of information & communication technology (ICT) and the Internet had brought forth diversified opportunities and challenges especially for the developing countries of the world. In a response to the changing landscape of knowledge and education, the then government of Bangladesh, during the 1990s, had revised its education policy to privatise tertiary education in order to make-up the supply deficit of skilled manpower in the country. And the concomitant shift in government’s education policy, which came into effect with the enactment of the Private University Act (PUA)-1992 (later repealed by the PUA-2010), had resulted in mushrooming of private universities in the country with majority being positioned in the capital Dhaka.",

        "During that period, there was only one state-funded university for the vast population of Sylhet—the north-eastern administrative division of the country. Due to its limited capacity that lone university could not accommodate all the aspirant students into its undergraduate and Master’s programmes as a result of which students from the economically solvent families had either been going abroad or to the private universities in Dhaka to pursue tertiary education. But the high costs of overseas education and the exorbitant fee structures of the then Dhaka-based private universities had left majority of the students of Sylhet region outside the purview of the then-existing tertiary education system.",

        `In such a backdrop,<strong><a href='/'>Dr. Toufique Rahman Chowdhury</a></strong>,a renowned banker and an entrepreneur, in conjunction with a number of renowned educationists from both home and abroad, had initiated the establishment of Metropolitan University with a vision to offer quality tertiary education at an affordable cost. The university had started its journey on 3rd May 2003 with only seventeen students enrolled in two departments, Business Administration and Computer Science & Engineering; the former offering both undergraduate (BBA) and Master’s (MBA) degrees while the latter offering only undergraduate (B.Sc.) degree programme. With the passage of time, however, some 3000 students have already been graduated from different departments and programmes while around 3500 students are currently pursuing undergraduate and Master’s degrees in various subjects under different departments of the university.`,

      question: "THE FOUNDER",
      answer: [
        "It is a rare phenomenon to have a moneyed man exhibit keen interest in education! Fortunately this rarity has come true at Metropolitan University. A graduate in Economics from University of Dhaka and a PhD in Development Economics from the USA, <span class=\"text-blue-500 font-bold\">Dr. Toufique Rahman Chowdhury </span> had more than twenty years of practical experience in Banking. He was the Chairman of Board of Directors and a sponsor Director of a leading private commercial bank as well as the Vice-Chairman and a sponsor Director of another private commercial bank. Dr. Chowdhury is an extensive traveler and a researcher by choice. His book Bangladesh in Perspective : the Political Economy of Corruption has been taught in different universities in the country as a textbook on governance & public policy. A visionary by nature, Dr. Chowdhury—currently the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the Apex body of the university—has been leading the university from the front towards its vision. A statement by Dr. Chowdhury resembles the core of the university’s business model: ” <span class=\"font-bold\">the sight of young, beautiful minds roaming around to acquire knowledge is a far more pleasant feeling than having trillion bucks in the bank account … we learn from our mistakes and step forward … complete customer care is our religion .”</span>",

        "Initially, the university started its operation in its city campus located at the heart of Sylhet city. With a space of 50,000+ sft. the city campus at present houses six academic departments and eight undergraduate and Master’s programmes.",
        "However, in a bid to keep pace with the burgeoning numbers of students, the university’s permanent campus is being built on a land area of 8.5 acres. Situated outside the city, the permanent campus would be the most comprehensive and architecturally iconic campus in the region, and is expected to be operational by December 2018.",
