        <p>
          The B.Sc. (CSE) programme is a 48 (forty-eight)-month study of 8
          semesters for regular students. A student should complete at least
          150credits to be a graduate. The program is intended for students who
          want to obtain a sound theoretical and technical knowledge in Computer
          Science. The job market in computer Science and Information Technology
          is robust and growing in a geometric profession in Bangladesh and
          throughout the world. Over the next several decades, Computer
          Scientist will continue to reshape our familiar world.

          What students will learn completing the program
        </p>
        <p>
          Completing the program students will be able to grasp the fundamental
          concepts in computer science and engineering, identify computational
          problems and devise algorithmic solutions. The programme helps to
          build software that can be employed to solve real-world problems with
          economic, environmental, social, political, health and safety,
          manufacturability, and sustainability constraints. Students will gain
          the aptitude to communicate and collaborate effectively with
          multidisciplinary teams in large-scale and complex projects and they
          will engage themselves in original research and contribute to the
          advancements in the field of computer science and engineering.
          Students will conduct computational experiments for analyzing and
          interpreting data and act according to their professional and ethical
          responsibility.
          <br />
          Students will be able to utilize modern computing languages,
          platforms, and tools necessary for engineering practice and they will
          engage in lifelong learning and self-development
