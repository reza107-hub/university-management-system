        <p>
          The BSc in Software Engineering is a 48 (forty-eight) months-long
          undergraduate programme for those, who intend to achieve a Bachelor of
          Science degree from the department of software engineering. Students
          have to complete 148 credits theory and lab courses along with 12
          credits internship from any reputed software development firm, a total
          of 160 credits to be a graduate. The programme is designed on the
          basis of outcome-based curriculum equipped with science & mathematics
          courses, general education courses, core computer science courses,
          specialized courses on software analysis, design, development,
          software quality assurance and a sufficient number of courses on most
          recent trends. The programme will motivate the graduates to go that
          extra mile through learning new skills and improving existing ones,
          which is a trait that can only be achieved by striving for excellence.

        </p>
        <p>
          After graduation, students will get the fundamental concepts of
          computer science as well as software engineering. They will be able to
          identify computational problems and devise algorithmic solutions. They
          will be able to build software that can be employed to solve
          real-world problems with economic, environmental, social, political,
          health and safety, manufacturability and sustainability constraints.
          Besides, they will achieve communication and managerial skills. The
          nine significant Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO) of the BSc.
          Programme are mentioned point wise.
